## 📖 Overview
Meem provides an intuitive platform for users to explore different products, manage cart items, and engage in a seamless shopping journey. Although the app does not currently include a checkout process or secure user authentication, it lays the groundwork for future enhancements with features like offline data access, caching, and efficient product management.

## ✨ Features
- *🔐 User Authentication*: Supports login and registration functionalities, including saving user tokens for session management.
- *🛒 Product Browsing*: Allows users to browse and search for products across various categories.
- *🛍 Cart Management*: Users can add or remove items from the shopping cart, with updates reflected in real-time.
- *📚 Category Exploration*: Provides a categorized view of products, enabling users to filter products by category.
- *👤 User Profile Management*: Allows updating user information like name, email, and phone.
- *📴 Offline Access*: Uses local storage for offline data access.
- *📱 Responsive Design*: Optimized for various screen sizes using flutter_screenutil.
- *🎨 Smooth Animations*: Enhances user experience with Lottie animations and shimmering effects for loading states.

## 📐 Architecture and Code Structure
The project follows a clean architecture, using separate layers for data, domain, and presentation. The architecture includes:
- *Data Layer*: Handles API interactions and data caching using remote data sources.
  - AuthRemoteDataSource, CartRemoteDataSource, and HomeDataSource are used for authentication, cart management, and product data retrieval respectively.
- *Presentation Layer*: Manages the app's UI using widgets and screens like CategoriesView for displaying categorized products.
- *Models*: Includes models for managing data throughout the app, such as AuthModel, ProductModel, UserInfoModel, CategoryModel, and PosterModel.
- *Utilities*: Core functionalities like saving tokens and API endpoint management are abstracted for easier code maintenance.

### 🔍 Example Code Snippets
1. *Authentication Implementation*
   - Login and Registration are managed using AuthRemoteDataSource and AuthRemoteDataSourceImpl:
     dart
     Future<AuthModel> login({required String email, required String password}) async {
       Map<String, dynamic> jsonData = await apiConsumer.post(
           endPoint: EndPoints.login,
           bodyData: {"email": email, "password": password},
           isFormData: true);
       AuthModel authModel = AuthModel.fromJson(jsonData);
       await saveToken(value: authModel.data?.token);
       return authModel;
     }
     
2. *Fetching Products*
   - Products are retrieved through the HomeDataSourceImpl class:
     dart
     Future<List<ProductModel>> getProducts() async {
       Map<String, dynamic> jsonData =
           await apiConsumer.get(endPoint: EndPoints.home);
       List<dynamic> results = jsonData["data"]["products"];
       List<ProductModel> products = [];
       for (var productData in results) {
         products.add(ProductModel.fromJson(productData));
       }
       return products;
     }
     

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- *Dart*: The programming language used for Flutter development.
- *Hive*: Manages local storage for offline capabilities.
- *Flutter Bloc*: Manages state across the app with a clean architecture approach.
